	<h1>Atlas - Navigate your spare time</h1>

    <h2>What</h2>
    <p>Atlas is a mobile focused web application designed to help users manage their spare time, specifically aimed at learning skills. With limited time in each day, especially after work, it can feel frustratingly wasteful to spend that time organising how to spend that time. </p>

    <p>After minimal set up, Atlas takes out the effort and simply provides you with a todo list of tasks that fit into any time frame, every day.</p>


    <h2>How</h2>
    <p>The backend is a Django REST API, and the frontend is generated with Django's templating system. While it may seem redundant to build the application in this way, it was a conscious decision. The reason being that this is a proof of concept, built in a way that is simultaneously forward thinking and the quickest way to technologically solve the problem outlined in the What section. As I use/test the application, I will discover what works and what doesn't, and use this information to refine the app and build out a more feature rich front end (using a fit for purpose front end framework) and a native mobile app. Using an API allows for this extensibility, and using Django's own templating system ensured the quickest and simplest solution (specific to my knowledge of web development).</p>

    <h2>Why</h2>
    <p>App stores in every ecosystem are saturated with ToDo apps. Despite this, I was unable to find one that scratched the itch I had. During my time working at a digital agency, my work was streamlined by my project manager, which freed me from the need to organise my time allowing me to focus on my work. I had a strong desire for such a workflow in my spare time, as I had many hobbies; keeping track of what I should be doing in each one to further my competence became tedious. And so, Atlas was born. </p>

    <h2>Todo:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add design elements to site</li>
        <li>Change the routing so a signed in user is redirected to list from home page</li>
        <li>Add ability to remove tasks and skills</li>
        <li>Format the time on the list page so that the hour part of the time is not displayed unless in use</li>
        <li>Change the way in which availability time is changed on overview page</li>
        <li>Replace the time field in the HTML (poorly supported)</li>
        <li>Add option to include breaks between tasks (with the ability to specify how often and how long breaks are - with defaults)</li>
        <li>Provide graphical representations of progress</li>
    </ul>
